In a client-side web development context, the styles folder (or simply styles folder) is a common convention used to store 
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files for styling the components and layouts of a web application. CSS files define the visual 
presentation and layout of HTML elements on web pages. 

Here's what you might find in a styles folder within a client-side project directory:
- CSS Files:
	- These files contain CSS rules and styles for your web application. You can organize CSS rules based on components, pages, or 	layout sections.
- SCSS or Sass Files (Optional):
	- SCSS (Sassy CSS) and Sass files provide additional features like variables, nesting, and mixins, making it easier to write and 	organize CSS.
- CSS Frameworks or Libraries - Third-party (Optional):
	- If your project utilizes CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize CSS, you might include the framework files or customized styles related to these frameworks in this folder.
- Themes or Variants (Optional):
	- If your application supports multiple themes or variants, you might organize theme-specific styles within subfolders.
- Utility Classes (Optional):
	- Some projects include utility classes that define common styles for quick application across elements without writing custom CSS 	rules each time.
