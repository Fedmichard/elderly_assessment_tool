Components are the building blocks of a UI. They are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that describe how a part of the UI 
should appear and behave. 

Here's a breakdown of the files that typical React component directory might contain:
- Component JavaScript File (.js or .jsx):
	- This file contains the actual React component code. It defines the component's structure, behavior, and rendering logic.
- Components Styles (Optional):
	- If your component has specific styles, you can create a seperate stylesheet for it. This file contains CSS or SCSS code 
	to style the components.
- Component Tests (Optional) - Test File:
	- If you are writing unit tests for your components (good practice), you can create a seperate test file for the component.
- Component Documentation (optional) - Markdown or Text File:
	- You can create a documentation file to describe the usage, props, or any other relevant information about the component
- Components Assets (Optional) - Images, Icons, etc.:
	- If your component uses specific images or icons, you can include them in an 'assets' subdirectory inside your component directory.
