## About
Our app will be structured around the actual assessment and information providing aspects. Our assessment will show things like examples of safe vs. unsafe websites/emails/messages and then provide a series of questions which will ask the user if the image above looks misleading or dangerous.

## Features
* Provide an assessment tool which will give a detailed report of how the user responds to Phishing attempts, how the user responds to non-Phishing attempts, how the user interacts with the visuals of a site, and things missed or not missed in the examples
* Provide a well thought out tutorial with examples and customization
* Provide resources from trusted outlets to enhance the learning of the user such as common threats and how to mitigate them
* Tips for creating a safe environment for their digital information
* We donâ€™t want to be too strict on our roles and titles, since everyone here are software engineers we want everyone to be involved in the development of this app as much as possible
* The saving of the assessments and user information
